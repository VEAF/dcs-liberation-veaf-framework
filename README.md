# VEAF Scripts as a plugin to dcs-liberation

All scripts, libraries and documentation needed to build a mission containing the VEAF framework with [dcs-liberation](https://github.com/Khopa/dcs_liberation).

## Playing in such a mission

*TODO*

## Refreshing the scripts in this repository

Requirements:

* git
* an IDE (Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, etc.)
* npm - you can install [node.js from here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Edit the `package.json` file to change the version of the VEAF framework you want to fetch.
Run the `build.cmd` script and then check that the scripts in `src` have been updated.
Commit.
